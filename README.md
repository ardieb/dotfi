# Tabernacle
Tabernacle is an application for tracking cryptocurrency P&amp;L for both tax and portfolio management purposes.
## Purpose
With increasing speculative interest in cyrptocurrencies from both institutions and retail investors, there is also increasing interest from government regulators. With regulation comes the need for good book-keeping -- Tabernacle makes booking on the blockchain easy by centralizing trades made on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into a single, easily digestable format.
